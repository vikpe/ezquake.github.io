<h3>Installing the client</h3>
<p>Download the latest client below. Full versions include the bare minimum of game media (basic hud graphics, player
    skins etc). If you want to experience modern graphics and other additional media in the game including custom
    configurations, try <a href="http://www.nquake.com">nQuake</a>.</p>
{% include download-latest.html %}

<p>Alternatively, you can build the client from source. Visit the <a href="https://github.com/ezQuake/ezquake-source">project
    page</a> on GitHub and follow the compilation instructions included.</p>

<h3>Installing Quake</h3>
<p>If you don't have Quake installed, you can now <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/2310/">buy Quake online</a>
    via Steam. This will give you the complete single-player game. Then download a 'Full' install above and copy to your
    Quake directory.</p>
<p>To get configured for competitive online games quickly, try <a href="http://www.nquake.com">nQuake</a>. nQuake
    includes standard config files, modern HUD, fullbright skins and 24-bit textures. Once nQuake is installed, download
    an Upgrade version of the client and replace the executable in your Quake directory.</p>
